    <h1>What are Semantic Elements?</h1>
        <p> Semantic elements describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer.
            Examples of non-semantic elements: Div and span - tell nothing about the content.
            Examples of semantic elements : img table and article - Clearly define their content
